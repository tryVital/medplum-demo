<h1 align="center">Medplum: Vital Demo</h1>

This project aims to integrate Vital with Medplum, providing seamless interoperability between the two platforms.
Vital is a powerful tool for managing healthcare data, and by integrating it with Medplum,
we enhance Medplumâ€™s capabilities for handling vital orders, lab results, and other critical health metrics.
