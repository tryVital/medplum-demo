<h1 align="center">Medplum: Vital Demo</h1>

 This project aims to integrate Vital with Medplum, providing seamless interoperability between the two platforms.
 Vital is a powerful tool for managing healthcare data, and by integrating it with Medplum,
 we enhance Medplumâ€™s capabilities for handling vital orders, lab results, and other critical health metrics.

 ## Setup and Configuration

 To configure the Vital integration you need to add the following secrets to your Medplum project:

 - `VITAL_API_KEY`: The API key for accessing the Vital API.
 - `VITAL_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the Vital API.

 ## Contribution

 We welcome contributions to improve this integration.
